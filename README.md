# Stats Case Study

## Goals

There are four high-level goals for this case study:

- Continue to gain experience using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy.Stats
- Create plots and tables that illustrate interesting relationships in your dataset where you are asking the questions you want answers to
- Execute a hypothesis test where you select the scientific questions answered
- Communicate your results to a non-technical audience

## Cars Dataset Description

- [Download the cars dataset here.](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/curriculum-download/671a20e86edf8f102be2719ae1526422/csv)

This data set includes information on various vehicles manufactured from 1970 through 1982. The dataset contains the following features:

- mpg: miles per gallon of vehicle
- cylinders: the number of cylinders in this vehicle
- horsepower: horsepower of vehicle
- weight: weight of vehicle in pounds
- acceleration: acceleration in ft/s^2
- model: Model year of the vehicle
- origin: Country of origin (1 is the United States, 2 is Germany, and 3 is Japan)
- car_name: Description of car

## Deliverables

### Presentation

This afternoon your group will present your results to the class from a Google Sheet or Powerpoint Presentation.

Your presentation should:

- Clearly state the goal of your project (what were you exploring? what scientific question did you ask?)

- Describe the data.
  - What features (columns) did you have to work with? What features were you interested in?

  - Were the features numerical/categorical/text?

  - Was a lot of data missing or other problems? If so, what did you do to handle it?

  - How did features relate to each other, and the values that you were interested in?
  - Pictures are worth 1000s of words!

- Clearly state the steps you took to execute a hypothesis test and what the result of the hypothesis test is.

You should assume that your audience is not technical when creating this presentation. Assume that members are not data analysts and they do not have deep knowledge of cars.
